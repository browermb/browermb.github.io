      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Home has never been easy for me, especially since I came to college.
          But this weekend I have made the trip back so my parents can attend
          their fly fishing class. All I can say is that they are much cooler
          than me. At my old age of 21 obviously I think of eventually starting
          a family. And the more I come home, the more I think I am inept. I
          don’t know if you guys have ever taken care of two dogs at once but
          that is about as much as I can handle and they are basically already
          full functioning beings. However, this weekend it has been abundantly
          clear that I might have to think twice about children. I remember
          hearing stories about throwing up in my moms mouth as a kid and
          thinking it was funny, not once did I think about how disgusting that
          would be. Here I was thinking I could handle it because I have picked
          up my dog’s diarrhea and man does his sh** stink. Henry, my dog, had
          not thrown up in the two and a half months. My mom always goes which
          dog is about to throw up when we hear heaving and proudly I say: “Not
          Henry, he doesn't throw up.” But today that all changed. Once again we
          hear that oh so pleasant sound of a dog about to throw up and I was
          like nope not Henry except this time it was. I plead with my mom
          please you clean it up that is so gross but she is distracted because
          her phone fell in the crack of the couch. So it is left to me. I go
          and grab a paper towel and while trying to hold Henry back I clean the
          throw up, up. The smell and warmth get to me and this time the heaving
          isnt a dog; instead, it is me. The carpet is now clean and the feeling
          of disgust has passed but I can’t say that I want to do it again. I
          may never enjoy cleaning up puke but maybe like my mom with time I
          will be able to joke about it.
