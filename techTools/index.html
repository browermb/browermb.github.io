                    <p>
                        First we must generate a public/private key pair. If you want to know more about this you will need to look more into RSA encryption. For this the command is: ssh-keygen. But without the period, maybe it seems silly but I have been the college student mistyping commands because I thought the period was part of it. Now this command is going to ask you where to store it so make sure you know where your home directory is and  store it in /home/.ssh/stu.cs.jmu.edu and no need to give it a password.

                        </figure>
                    </p>
                    <p> Before we add the key into our authorized key file let's ssh into stu and add some information to our ssh config. Place the following information but with your e-id
                            <figure>
                                    <img class = "fit-picture"

                        Now let's ssh into stu to edit our authorized keys!

                    <p>
                        In order to edit this run the following command: vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys <br>
                        Then paste the contents of the contents of your public key e.g. the stuff we just generated e.g. paste the contents of /home/.ssh/stu.cs.jmu.edu.pub <br>
                        If you dont quite know where to get this you can type : cat /home/.ssh/stu.cs.jmu.edu.pub and then copy and paste

                    </div>
                    <h5 id = "Github">Lots of people dont know how to use Github. You basically need 4 commands and it could save you so much headache. I have peronally overwritten numerous PAs and version control has saved my grades</h5>
                    <p>
                        So lets say that you have created a git repository or maybe your teacher created on for you for some assignment. <br>
                        The first step is to clone the repository so you can add your code to it from your machine. To do this you need to go the the github page and you should see a clone or download button in the top right. Copy the link to it.
                        Now back in the command line type "git clone link" where link is the appropriate place. Note that this will create the repository wherever you are so make sure you are located in the directory you want. 
                    </p>
                    <p> If you dont have a repository created yet but instead need to initialize on         you would type "git init". <br> <br>
                    
                        Now what is the process of adding code to the repository: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> "git status" tells you the current status of your local repo</li>
                            <li> "git add *" this means adds all my files you can add just specific files by saying "git add hi.py" This specifies which files are going to be added to the repository</li>
                            <li> "git commit -m "a message descriping your changes"" Now this command will commit your changes to your local repository but doesnt make changes to the remote repository</li>
                            <li> "git push" this will push your changes to the remote repository</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        Now these are the commands you will need for your own repository. If this is a repository with multiple team members you will need one more.
                        Lets say your teammate made changes to your group's code and now you need the most up to date code. you would say "git pull". Everytime you are about to push code to a shared repository you need to call this command. This could lead to merge conflicts meaning there were changes that were made while you were working on the same code. You would need to fix this conflicts and then push your code. 
                        <br>
                        There are a plenty of commands that are out there but these are the mains ones that you would be using. The only other one I have touched is "git checkout" and this is to "checkout" a branch but I will leave it up to you to learn what that means. 
                        <br>
                        One of I have just recently learned about is "git diff". You can use this in multiple different ways. One way is you have made some changes git diff will tell you where these changes are and whether they are addition or subtractions. Happy coding!
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <h5 id = "SCP">Next I am going to talk about a way to transfer files from stu to your local machine without using something like WinSCP</h5>
                    <p> Unfortunately, I do not know much about this command but look forward to the opportunity to learn more about it. <br> For now I will provide what I do know. So there are two different file transfer commands scp and ftp. You <strong>always</strong> want to use scp because it is secure. So to transfer a file from stu to your machine you would type in the terminal "scp e-id@stu.cs.jmu.edu: path-to-file place-you-want-it" The last part of the path to file will be the /fileName.extension. Also you can say "." to mean place it where I am currently located. If you want an entire folder instead of a file it is the same command with a -r meaning recursive (I believe) so you would say "scp -r e-id@stu.cs.jmu.edu: path-to-file place-you-want-it" Now stu is just a host. So you can scp from other hosts but this is all the information I can provide you with</p>
