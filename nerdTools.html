                    <p>  <tag id = "SSHKeyGen "> Below I have included the steps to generate ssh keys so you dont need to log in every time as well as images with me doing it myself </tag></p>
                    <p>
                        First we must generate a public/private key pair. If you want to know more about this you will need to look more into RSA encryption. For this the command is: ssh-keygen. But without the period, it might seem silly but I have been the college student mistyping commands because I thought the period was part of it. Now this command is going to ask you where to store it so make sure you know where your home directory is and  store it in /home/.ssh/stu.cs.jmu.edu and gosh forbid please dont give it a password.

                    </p>
                    <p> Before we add the key into our authorized key file let's ssh into stu and add some information to our ssh config. Place the following information but with your e-id

                                    <img class = "fit-picture"
                                    src = "config.png"
                                    width = "500"
                                    />

                    <p>
                        Now let's ssh into stu to edit our authorized keys! I know this is so much fun and you want it to continue to forever, unfortunately, though we only have a couple more steps. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to edit this run the following command: vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys <br>
                        Then paste the contents of the contents of your public key e.g. the stuff we just generated e.g. paste the contents of /home/.ssh/stu.cs.jmu.edu.pub <br>
                        If you dont quite know where to get this you can type : cat /home/.ssh/stu.cs.jmu.edu.pub and then copy and paste
