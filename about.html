          <h3 class="page-heading">Hi. I am Madelaine Brower.</h3>
          <p>
            This year I am senior at James Madison University. I am currently
            studying computer science and mathematics with a minor in robotics.
            In the future, I hope to go on to get my doctorate and then work to
            improve prothestics. Afterwards I have started to refine the classes
            that I am taking that will relate to the field of rehabilitative
            robotics. While I continue to develop this website please feel free
            to email me if you have any questions or want to talk. You may also
            visit my other pages, one if which is still under development.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Research Interests
          </h3>
          <p>
            My research interests are brain-machine interfaces and areas within
            the intersection of biomechatronics and intelligent systems. My
            interests are driven by a desire to make a difference in the world
            and in peopleâ€™s lives combined with working in the field of computer
            science and robotics. Below I have listed some articles of some of
            the incredible things that we can accomplish as people and a field
            that I hope I can add to.

          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently not working on any research projects. This past
            summer I worked on creating an autonomous golfcart to serve as a
            taxi system in a retirement community. This fall I am in a class
            revolving around the project. Please check back for updates on the
            cart.
          </p>
          <p>
            In spring 2018 an autonomous vehicles class was taught at JMU XLabs.
            The purpose of this course was to take a normal golfcart and
            transform it so that it is able to drive around on its own. This
            project gained a lot of attention and more importantly attention of
            one of the retirement communities in the local area. The spring
            course was very successful and at the end the golfcart was able to
            drive around the parking lot at JMU XLabs by itself.
            <a href="https://youtu.be/bCi4ClAqEqU">Here</a> is a video of the
            final product! The attention from the retirement community birthed
            an idea of creating an autonomous taxi system for a retirement
            community.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this newfound direction of the project, a group was brought
            together in May 2019. Unfortunately, another class had been taught
            and the previous work that had been done was rolled back. It was
            then my responsibility to make the cart drive autonmously once
            again. By the end of the summer we had a new golfcart and were able
            to control the acceleration and brakes autonmously. By the end of
            the summer this is what our progress looked <a href="">like</a>!
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that the semester has begun our group of members working on this
            expanded from six to about 25. We had four teams that worked on
            separate part of the projects. I had the privilege of continuing to
            work on the hardware portion of the project with the goal of being a
            resource for the new members but also to hone some of the skills I
            picked up over the summer. Later in the semester than we had hoped
            we had the cart fully outfitted to be autonomous.
            <a href="https://youtu.be/lKFB6VVzYUw">Here</a> is what this point
            in the project looked like!. At this point I switched teams to the
            AI/Robotics team and have since been working on obstacle avoidance.
