          <h3 class="page-heading">Hi. I am Madelaine Brower.</h3>
          <p>
            This year I am junior at James Madison University. I am currently
            studying computer science and mathematics with a minor in robotics.
            I have started to refine the classes that I am taking that will
            relate to the field of rehabilitative robotics. While I continue to
            develop this website please feel free to email me if you have any
            questions or just want to talk. You may also visit my other pages,
            one if which is still under development.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Research Interests
          </h3>
          <p>
            My research interests are brain-machine interfaces and areas within
            the intersection of biomechatronics and intelligent systems. My
            interests are driven by a desire to make a difference in the world
            and in peopleâ€™s lives combined with working in the field of computer
            science and robotics. In the future, I hope to go on to get my
            doctorate and then work to improve prothestics. Below I have listed
            some articles of some of the incredible things that we can
            accomplish as people and a field that I hope I can add to.

          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently working on two research projects. The first project,
            I am currently developing an application for creating geometric
            constructions on the sphere with Dr. John Bowers. The goal of this
            project is to help mathematicians study circle-packing with
            visualizing and exploring inversive geometry. The application
            currently has constructions to draw a member of a coaxial family
            among others. You are welcome to follow my progress
            <a href="https://arsgeometricalab.com" id="here">here</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The other project I am working on is called Wearables for Physical
            Therapy and is Dr. Jason Forsyth's project. Generally with physical
            therapy, a patient must go to an office to be observed and then must
            continue them at home. This provides a couple of issues: people
            might not be able to go see a physical therapist every week, they
            also might not do the exercises or they might not do them well.
            Wearables is a system that a patient will wear when performing their
            provided activies, it would then store this data, send it to the
            physical therapist, and provide feedback to the patient as to how
            they are doing and what they may need to correct.
