      <h3 class="title">The Imposter Syndrome</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          My sophomore year of college I felt so inadequate that I was going to
          drop out of computer science and completely alter my after college
          plans. What exacerbated these feelings was the belief that I was the
          only one who felt this way and because I was the only one who felt
          this way it reiterated the idea that computer science was not the
          major for me. There was one thing that I can remember that made me
          feel better; I confided in my peers. Specifically, a female student
          who was incredibly intelligent, who worked really hard and whose hard
          work paid off, to my surprise she felt the same way I did and had also
          almost dropped the major. This experience has driven me to work on
          educating others about the imposter syndrome so they do not need to
          feel as if they are the only ones experiencing these feelings.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a female undergraduate student in a male dominated field it is easy
          to think that just about everybody knows about the imposter syndrome.
          But, what always surprises me is how many people feel this way and
          think they are the only one; myself included. The imposter syndrome is
          the feeling or idea that your success is due to external factors such
          as luck. People who experiences this also worry that people are going
          to find out that they are an “imposter” that they do not have the
          knowledge or skills for their current position and are somehow passing
          by. Many people who experience the imposter syndrome often believe
          that they are not as skilled as their peers, they are the only one
          struggling, they often wonder how they got in their position.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is believed that people who are within a field that is a dominated
          by the opposite sex are affected more by the opposite sex, probably
          due to feelings of unbelonging, e.g. women in computer science. People
          who exhibit imposter syndrome are aware of how their peers view them
          but are unable to attribute their success to things such as skills and
          intelligence. These feelings result in heightened levels of anxiety
          and stress. As a result, people will put in more work hours which can
          lead to burn out. The combination of anxiety, stress, and burn out
          causes a stronger case of imposter syndrome creating a cycle. The
          cycle caused by feelings of the imposter syndrome results in an
          attempt to lower people’s expectations; this can get so intense that
          people will turn down opportunities for growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The imposter syndrome can be detrimental to success, so what do we do?
          There have been a couple of things shown to help and a few that I can
          personally speak to are: a feeling of belonging, increased mentorship,
          and awareness. Sometimes my feelings of being an imposter are so
          severe that I am paralyzed. A constant anxiety that I will never be as
          smart or as skilled as my peers makes me want to shut down, I question
          why I should continue to work hard. Learning I was not the only one
          who experiences these feelings helped enormously because I was not
          alone. If I am not the only one experiencing this than it speaks less
          about me as an individual. On top of that I confide in my professors.
          They are able to help me internalize my success; they are able to help
          become more aware of my success. I still struggle with the imposter
          syndrome consistently but the awareness I have gained from educating
          myself and opening myself up to others has allowed me to continue to
          work through it and continue to do my best to be as successful as I
          can.
