                <h1>College for Kids - Python: Lab 1</h1>
                <h6>In this lab you will be creating a madlib. I have provided some default code for you.
                    Follow the directions and then we will present to the class. If you finish before
                    the class is ready to present then you may work on the advanced version or play
                    computer games while you respectfully wait.
                </h6>
                <p> Download the following file <br> First using what you have learned
                about variables declare 19 variables <br> 
                <a href = "madlib.py">Madlib Lab</a>
                </p>

                <h6>
                    If you have already finished the lab follow the instructions below for
                    an advanced version of the madlib lab.
                </h6>

                <p>In programming there is something that we call lists. It is exactly
                    like your familiy's grocery list! It is just something that contains
                    a bunch of items. However, in Python these lists can store things other than 
                    just grocery itmes. For example we can have a list of numbers and that would
                    look like [3, 4, 5]. Lists work just like variables where I can save the 
                    value into a name. For example, numbers = [3, 4, 5] then if I wanted to get 
                    the number 3 I would say numbers[0]. Coding is weird and counting usually
                    starts at 0 and not one. We can add and delete things to lists but
                    for right now all you need to know is to add to a list I would say
                    numbers.append(6).
                </p>

                <h6>Your goal for this lab is to use lists and the random library to generate
                a random madlib. Make sure to read the documentation of the random library
                before you start. And dont worry, we will talk about libraries later</h6>

                <p>For this lab you will store lists of nouns, adjectives, adverbs 
                    and whatever else you need. You should ask the user for these
                    and then put them in your list. Then when filling out the madlib
                    one gets randomly selected.
                </p>
