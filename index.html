                        My name is Madelaine Brower. This year I am junior at James Madison University. I am currently studying computer science and mathematics with a minor in robotics. I have started to refine the classes that I am taking that will relate to the field of rehabilitative robotics. While I continue to develop this website please feel free to email me if you have any questions or just want to talk. You may also visit my other pages, one if which is still under development.

                        I am currently working on two research projects. The first project, I am currently developing an application for creating geometric constructions on the sphere with Dr. John Bowers. The goal of this project is to help mathematicians study circle-packing with visualizing and exploring inversive geometry.
                        The application currently has constructions to draw a member of a coaxial family among others. You are welcome to follow my progress <a href = "https://arsgeometricalab.com" id = "here">here</a> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            The other project I am working on is called Wearables for Physical Therapy and is Dr. Jason Forsyth's project. Generally with physical therapy, a patient must go to an office to be observed and then must continue them at home. This provides a couple of issues: people might not be able to go see a physical therapist every week, they also might not do the exercises or they might not do them well. Wearables is a system that a patient will wear when performing their provided activies, it would then store this data, send it to the physical therapist, and provide feedback to the patient as to how they are doing and what they may need to correct.

                        My research interests are brain-machine interfaces and areas within the intersection of biomechatronics and intelligent systems. My interests are driven by a desire to make a difference in the world and in peopleâ€™s lives combined with working in the field of computer science and robotics. In the future, I hope to go on to get my doctorate and then work to improve prothestics. Below I have listed some articles of some of the incredible things that we can accomplish as people and a field that I hope I can add to.
